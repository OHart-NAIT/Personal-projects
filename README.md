#Welcome to my Personal Projects!

Welcome to the folder of my personal projects. It's not much, just a growing collection of things I work on occasionally, born mainly out of curiosity and a desire to keep my skills sharp. Each project here is a small sandbox where I try out new ideas, solve problems that interest me, and learn by doing.

I build everything from scratch, often starting with notes on my phone. I write all the HTML, plan the CSS styling, and develop the JavaScript myself. This hands-on, ground-up approach helps me understand not just how things work, but why they work that way—especially given all the nuances and challenges that come with testing and styling things correctly.

For me, I hope this folder becomes more than just a personal log of my journey as a developer; I’d like it to evolve into a portfolio of sorts. That said, my goal with these projects is never perfection, but progress. I hope each iteration reflects a deeper understanding, a cleaner solution, or a greater appreciation for a particular concept.

Looking ahead, I’m excited to expand my knowledge in all sorts of ways—whether that means learning a new programming language or simply creating another project about something that interests me while refining my skills. In turn, I hope to make this space an environment where that progress unfolds—one fun, self-directed project at a time.

If you’d like to know more about how I built something, have questions about a concept I explored, or just want to connect—please feel free to reach out at oliver.hart0131@gmail.com. I’m always happy to talk shop, share ideas, or just chat about day-to-day life.
